This is a program written to help narrow in on a solution to the common Tarzan Swing physics problem.

# IMAGINE THIS
You are running as fast as you can through the jungle with fifty head-hunters chasing you. Your
breath is short, and your mouth is dry, but there is no stopping. For if you stop, you die.
Suddenly there’s a cliff.
Beside you - a vine.
Across the chasm – a cave.
Do you swing across?
Of course, you do! You are “Tarzan, King (or Queen) of the Jungle”!
But consider:
1. What if sharp rocks surround the cave? How will you avoid them?
2. What if obstacles (huge rocks) are sticking up from the bottom of the chasm? How will you
avoid them?
3. What if you must let go of your vine part way across the chasm? Can you still safely make it
to the cave?

These are just a few of the situations that could develop if you were “Tarzan, King (or Queen) of the
Jungle.”

Now, it is your job NOT to be “Tarzan, King (or Queen) of the Jungle,” but to be “Tarzan, King (or
Queen) of the Classroom.” There are multiple levels of difficulty in this task you will attempt to
conquer. The higher the level, the more advanced the calculations. It will be your job to get Tarzan
across the chasm free of injury (in this case get a water balloon safely through a square hole in
plywood surrounded by pins).

Your instructor will give you certain variables, and you will be expected to calculate the others. You
will then swing the water balloon using your findings. If you are correct, Tarzan will go into the
cave without harm. But if you are wrong, get ready for the water to fly.

GOOD LUCK!
